## Project Information
This GitHub repository contains a modification of MIT's x86 OS [xv6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public) from the default 1-tick fair-share scheduler to a variant of [BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_Fuck_Scheduler).

Note that the OS no longer functions when performing multithreaded operations due to project specification limitations.
